# NLP-Toolkit-OOP
A Python-based NLP command-line toolkit that allows users to perform Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Language Detection using the NLPCloud API. The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

This is a Python command-line application that performs Natural Language Processing tasks like:

- 🔍 Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- 🌍 Language Detection
- 😀 Sentiment Analysis

The project is designed with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles:
- ✅ Encapsulation
- ✅ Inheritance
- ✅ Abstraction
- ✅ Polymorphism

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- [NLPCloud API](https://nlpcloud.io/)
- JSON for simple database
- Command-line interface (CLI)

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install nlpcloud
   ```

2. Add your NLPCloud API key to your environment:
   ```bash
   export NLP_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
